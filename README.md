# Enviro+ and PMS5003 case



## About

*Designed for environmental monitoring, Enviro+ for Raspberry Pi lets you measure air quality (pollutant gases and particulates), temperature, pressure, humidity, light, and noise level. When combined with a particulate matter sensor, it's great for monitoring air quality just outside your house (more information below), or without the particulate sensor you can use it to monitor indoor conditions.*[1]

- BME280 temperature, pressure, humidity sensor ([datasheet](https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BME280-DS002.pdf))
- LTR-559 light and proximity sensor ([datasheet](references/ltr-559als-01_ds_v1.pdf))
- MICS6814 analog gas sensor ([datasheet](references/1143_Datasheet-MiCS-6814-rev-8.pdf))
- ADS1015 analog to digital converter (ADC) ([datasheet](references/ads1015.pdf))
- MEMS microphone ([datasheet](references/SPH0645LM4H-B.pdf))
- 0.96" colour LCD (160x80)
- PMS5003 particulate matter sensor

The sensors on the Enviro+ are very sensitive. The default design, where the sensor board is placed directly above the Raspberry Pi (Zero) is not great. The heat coming from the CPU of the RPi has a big influence on the BME280 temperature sensor. To overcome this, I designed a frame for mounting the Raspberry Pi Zero, the Enviro+ and the PMS5003, where the GPIO pins are connected with a ribbon cable.
